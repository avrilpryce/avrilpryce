# Hey, I’m A.P. 👋🏾✨  
**Frontend engineer → Backend-in-training (Python) | Music + tech forever 🎶💻**

## Almost died… but coding saved me ⚡️
Okay, it was more of a **spiritual death** 😅 — but still.  
Like a lot of people, COVID-19 flipped my world upside down. I spent **5+ years** in music + events, living on adrenaline: planning the next soirée, solving chaos with finesse, and getting pulled in a million directions.

Then the industry hit pause. Hard.

One day I was listening to music, staring into the void, asking:  
**“A.P., who are you without the next event?”** 🤔

I switched from my iPhone to my MacBook and got that little prompt:  
**“Continue playing music on your computer?”**  
And my brain went: **WAIT… TECH.** 💡

That moment kicked off my pivot — and it brought me here.
